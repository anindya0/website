   <p>
I am a computer scientist interested in the science of computer programming.
</p>
<p>
Currently I am Program Director in the <a href=http://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=CCF>Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF)</a> of the <a href=http://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=CISE>Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)</a>
at the US <a href=http://www.nsf.gov>National Science Foundation</a>. 
I am on leave from  <a href=http://software.imdea.org>The IMDEA Software Institute</a> in Madrid, Spain, where I am full professor since 2009. Between 2001--2008, I was full professor in the <a href=http://www.cis.ksu.edu>Dept. of Computing and Information Sciences</a>, Kansas State University.

<h3>
Research
</h3>
<p>
I am fascinated by the ideal of implementing software that is correct by construction. Yes, this ideal is achievable. Witness the tremendous progress, since 2000, in the science of software verification as well as in the engineering of verified software tools.
</p>
<p>
My primary research activities concern the development of theories, tools and experiments that embody principles of reasoning about security properties as well as functional behaviours of sequential, concurrent, networked and distributed software. In some form or the other, my work tries to answer the question: "Does your software do what it is supposed to do?" 
</p>
<p>
My research spans software security, software verification, probabilistic programming, semantics and logics of programs, abstract interpretation, program analysis and program transformation.
